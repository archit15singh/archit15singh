> I build backend systems that remain **reliable at scale**, are **observable under failure**, and are optimized for **real-time detection, memory, and search**.
> Over 8 years across infra-heavy teams, I’ve shipped telemetry pipelines, distributed orchestrators, and GenAI-backed systems under concurrency, latency, and audit constraints.

## 🔩 What I Build

* **Distributed Cloud Applications** → predictable scale, safe concurrency, recoverable failure modes
* **Stream Processing Pipelines** → Kafka + Redis + Postgres under **10M+ monthly events**
* **Telemetry & Observability Systems** → OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, SLA dashboards
* **LLM Agent Infrastructure** → memory-augmented, tool-using multi-agent systems
* **Control Planes & Coordination** → consensus, retries, failover, eventual consistency

---

## 🧠 Core Expertise

* **Distributed Systems**: queues, consensus, state machines, async orchestration
* **Infra Design**: ingestion, feature stores, detection pipelines, error budgets
* **Memory & Search**: Redis state machines, Postgres/pgvector, vector search, explainability
* **Observability**: tracing, metrics, SLA diagnostics, chaos/fault injection
* **GenAI Integration**: structured planning, retrieval, evaluation pipelines
* **Cloud & Ops**: Docker, AWS (ECS, CloudWatch, S3), Terraform, Kubernetes

---

## 🚀 Key Outcomes

* Designed streaming pipelines handling **10M+ events/month**
* Reduced **cross-region failures by 35%** through retry-safe orchestration
* Cut **ETL latency by 30%** in telemetry-heavy clinical systems
* Built **entity-scoring detection pipelines** surfacing explainable signals for ML models
* Logged full **agent memory + tool usage telemetry** for enterprise GenAI workflows
* Early Redis-based observability platform → **acquired by Redis Inc (folded into RedisInsight)**

## 🛠️ Featured Projects

🧠 [memori](https://github.com/archit15singh/memori)
Open-source, production-grade **memory substrate** for AI systems. Append-only log in Postgres, fast semantic recall with pgvector, short-term caching in Redis, and lightweight knowledge graph for provenance. Includes reflection jobs, PII redaction, and right-to-delete policies — because **memory should be infrastructure**.
