# Archit Singh

### Senior Backend Engineer | Infra & System Design @ Scale  
*Kafka · Redis · Python · Postgres · GenAI · Distributed Systems · Observability*

> I design backend systems that stay reliable at scale, adapt fast to product needs, and fail predictably.  
> 8+ years across infra-heavy teams building telemetry pipelines, orchestrators, and LLM-backed systems under concurrency, latency, and audit constraints.

## 🔩 What I Build

- **Distributed Cloud Applications** → Microservices with predictable scale & recoverability  
- **Stream Processing Pipelines** → Kafka + Postgres + Redis under 10M+ event loads  
- **Telemetry + Observability Systems** → Tracing, metrics, SLA diagnostics (Prometheus, OTel)  
- **LLM Agent Infrastructure** → Memory-backed, tool-using multi-agent execution engines  
- **Control Plane & Coordination** → Consensus-safe orchestration, retries, failover resilience  

---

## 🧠 Core Expertise

- **Distributed Systems**: queues, state machines, eventual consistency  
- **Infra Design**: ingestion, orchestration, API contracts, failure budgets  
- **Stream Processing**: Kafka, Redis, Celery, Prefect  
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry  
- **GenAI Integration**: agent memory, structured planning, tool use  
- **Cloud & Ops**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS (ECS, CloudWatch), Terraform (basic)  

---

## 🚀 Key Outcomes

- Built streaming ingestion pipelines handling **10M+ events/month**  
- Cut P95 latency by **45%** and ETL time by **30%** in clinical telemetry  
- Reduced **cross-region failures by 35%** through retry-safe orchestration  
- Logged **full agent memory + tool usage telemetry** for enterprise GenAI workflows  
- Redis-based observability platform **acquired by Redis Inc (folded into RedisInsight)**
